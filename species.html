				<p class="topic">The bottom-dwelling, jelly-bodied nudibranch might seem an unlikely canvas for Mother Nature to express her wildest indulgences of color and form. But these shell-less mollusks, part of the sea slug family, bear some of the most fascinating shapes, sumptuous hues, and intricate patterns of any animal.</p>
				<p class="topic">Oblong in shape, nudibranchs can be thick or flattened, long or short, ornately colored or drab to match their surroundings.</p>

				<h1><b>Puffer Fish</b></h1>
				<p class="topic">Pufferfish, also known as blowfish, developed their famous “inflatability” because their slow, somewhat clumsy swimming style makes them vulnerable to predators. In lieu of escape, pufferfish use their highly elastic stomachs and the ability to quickly ingest huge amounts of water to turn themselves into a virtually inedible ball several times their normal size.</p>

				<h1><b>Tardigrade</b></h1>
				<p class="topic">Around 1,300 species of tardigrades are found worldwide. Considered aquatic because they require a thin layer of water around their bodies to prevent dehydration, they’ve also been observed in all kinds of environments, from the deep sea to sand dunes. Freshwater mosses and lichens are their preferred habitat, hence their nickname, moss piglet.</p>

				<h1><b>Siphonophore</b></h1>
				<p class="topic">Hunting is left to the bodies that dangle tentacles with powerful neurotoxins, snagging small shrimp and such that are unfortunate enough to wander into its curtain of death. The prey is enveloped by the feeding body, digested, and dispersed to the rest of the colony by way of the stem. This nutrition is particularly important for the energy-hungry jet propulsion bodies at the front of the critter, which suck water in and squirt it out again to get the siphonophore moving.</p>

				<h1><b>Comb Jelly</b></h1>
				<p class="topic">As their name implies, comb jelly bodies are gelatinous. Species that live near the water surface are transparent, but those that live deeper in the water or parasitize other animals may be brightly colored. Some species have tentacles. Most species have eight strips of cilia, called comb rows, that run the length of their body. Ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia for locomotion. The comb rows scatter light and produce a rainbow effect.</p>

				<h1><b>Immortal Jellyfish</b></h1>
				<p class="topic">Turritopsis dohrnii is now officially known as the only immortal creature. The secret to eternal life, as it turns out, is not just living a really, really long time. It’s all about maturity, or rather, the lack of it. The immortal jellyfish (as it is better known popularly) propagate and then, faced with the normal career path of dying, they opt instead to revert to a sexually immature stage.</p>

				<p class="topic">The sea butterflies are a species of mollusk that live in the sea. They can be caught during winter and are the only winter fish that cast such a small shadow in the sea, and so can be identified with ease.</p>
				<p class="topic">Besides being majestic and mesmerizing, the little guys are a crucial part of the marine food web. Some types create webs of mucous that catch and filter organic particles that rain from the shallow waters above, and ingest them as a food source.</p>

These cone-shaped worms are one of the most widely recognized sedentary polychaete worms.The colorful plumes, or tentacles, are used for passive feeding on suspended food particles and plankton in the water.</p>

				<h1><b>Dumbo Octopus</b></h1>
				<p class="topic">Dumbo octopuses live in the deep open ocean down to depths of at least 13,100 feet and perhaps much deeper, making this group the deepest living of all known octopuses. Life at these extreme depths requires the ability to live in very cold water and in the complete absence of sunlight. Dumbo octopuses are naturally rare, and the deep sea is enormous, so these species have specialized behaviors to increase the likelihood that they can successfully reproduce anytime that they find a mate.</p>

				<h1><b>Axolotl</b></h1>
				<p class="topic">The axolotl salamander has the rare trait of retaining its larval features throughout its adult life. This condition, called neoteny, means it keeps its tadpole-like dorsal fin, which runs almost the length of its body, and its feathery external gills, which protrude from the back of its wide head.</p>

				<p class="topic">Axolotls are long-lived, surviving up to 15 years on a diet of mollusks, worms, insect larvae, crustaceans, and some fish.</p>
